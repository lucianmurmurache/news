# news - a news app that searches and reads news for you

## Built using create-react-app, [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and [Alan-ai](https://alan.app/)

- The user can request the news via a voice command, such as **"Get me the news from BBC News"**, or **"Show me the news from CNN"**
- The request can also be based on categories, such as _Science_, _Technology_ and so on, the command would then be **"Show me the latest Science news"**
- The user can also make a request based on terms, such as _JavaScript_ or _Vue_, the command in this case would be **"What's new about Vue?"**
